This is likely due to the increased interest in hockey in the US, as well as the fact for the US does not have the same system as Canada for young players. In Canada young players are drafted to a team in the WHL, OHL, or QMJHL depending on where they live. However, in the US the best young players can choose to play for the US Development team meaning the best young players almost always come from their team."
