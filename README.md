## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The NHL Players Statistics dataset is a collection of stats on every player who has been drafted into the National Hockey League since 1963. It includes the playerâ€™s draft year, junior team, as well as his career statistics in the NHL. The dataset also provides career totals and team information for each player. This dataset can be used to analyze player performance and identify trends and patterns in player development and success. It allows for comparisons between different draft classes and evaluations of team scouting and drafting processes. The data has been collected since 1963 by humans tracking each NHL game and logging the data. Additionally, the country of origin information can be used to study the distribution of NHL talent and determine which regions produce the most successful NHL players. The dataset provides valuable insights into the career of NHL players, as well as the value of draft picks in later rounds and the likelihood that a player makes the NHL. It is a useful resource for teams looking to draft talented players and what regions they should focus on youth scouting for their different positional needs.
